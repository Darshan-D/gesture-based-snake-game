# gesture-based-snake-game
We use OpenCV to track the motion of an object and then control the snake accordingly.

# Pipeline
1. Detect the object on the basis of color
2. Find the centre of the object
3. Compare this centre with previous centre to find the change in direction
4. Change the direction of the snake accordingly

- Note
1. As of now it by default works with blue color, you can change which color it detects by changing the code
